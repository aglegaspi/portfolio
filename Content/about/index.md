### Random Facts:

* Music is my first love and got my start in the music business at the age of 15. After making numerous calls to my favorite artists management company.

* The first website I created was dedicated to the genre of dance music called Freestyle also known as Latin Hip Hop. Used the hosting service Tripod, Paint Shop Pro for graphics, multi-frames, and JavaScript for a custom welcome message.

* I love biking, cooking, making playlists, learning random information, cartoons, and reading The Hustle.

* Used to currate playlists for actress/singer Vanessa Williams iPod before streaming took over the world.
